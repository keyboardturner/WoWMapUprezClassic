# WoWMapUprezClassic
A project to uprez every single low quality map in WoW using SRCNNs. All fully constructed maps will result in 4k resolution.

This project does not include any maps which are already 4k resolution, such as the ones pertaining to Battle for Azeroth.

Download at your own risk.

# Installation:

1. At the project page, click `Clone or download` and select `Download ZIP`. It may take a while to download because it's very big (It's about 551MB compressed / download).
2. When the file is finished downloading, find the `_classic_` directory and open it.
3. When you open the .zip file, it may have `WoWMapUprezClassic-master`. Inside that should have the contents `Interface` and a `README.md`.
4. Simply drag-drop to merge the `interface` folder in your WoW folder and replace the currently existing one. Below is a gif showing what is done.

If you're updating to a new version, make sure to approve files being overwritten. This process can take some time to complete.

If you've followed these steps, it should be done! Changes will take restarting your WoW client to take effect.

Quick Q&A:

Q: "Where are the Raid / Dungeon maps?"

> A: Those did not exist in Classic and it would be very difficult to implement. Technically possible with very complicated coding and math skills, but not something I wish to tackle. If somebody else wants to make the code basis, I can create the maps. Otherwise, no.

Q: "How long did this project take?"

> A: Approximately 17 hours to upscale & convert. The process is automated, so my own personal time is about 2 hours. I make my laptop take breaks so not to stress the hardware too long.

Q: "What are the specs of the laptop?"

> A: [i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-4720HQ+%40+2.60GHz&id=2448), 16 GB DDR3 RAM, [GTX 960M](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+960M&id=3176)+Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600. It's moderately powerful, a bit on the low/cheap end in regards to gaming laptops. It's sufficed for the past 5 years or so. I would get a better machine, but at the time of writing this I'm entrenched in college work.

Q: "Why was this made?"

> A: Just felt like fun. I read up on [SRCNNs](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html) and thought maybe I should take a jab at it. I also additionally liked seeing similar work done in some Skyrim mods for [Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26103?tab=images) and [Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26104?tab=images). I did some earlier projects where I wanted to do it by hand, but inevitably I felt I would diverge from the original maps and alter them in a way others wouldn't like. This would have been a lot more time and effort involved. Perhaps in the future I might consider more interesting projects to make the maps adhere closer to how they are in lore, such like the [Chronicle maps](https://i.imgur.com/35Y0pdi.jpg), or maybe even craft them in the Chronicle style. No plans currently, and certainly no ETA.

Q: "Why not change the maps?"

> A: These maps are intended to stay 100% "vanilla." No alterations, no changes. Only minor "bug fixes" ([Pandaria continent map](https://twitter.com/keyboardturn/status/1218823545028927489).) Even then, I have listed what has been altered and what changes have been made.

Q: "Why not charge money?"

> A: It's not something I like to do. This is a hobby, not a job. I do accept donations. I'm never in it for the money. Until I get my paypal set up, you can donate gold to my WoW characters. I play on US servers, so sorry for any EU fans: [Simaia-WyrmrestAccord](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/simaia) or [Kaestra-WyrmrestAccord](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/kaestra).

Q: "Do you work for Blizzard?"

> A: No. Not sure if this is what I'd primarily like to work on if I did. I'd much rather work on WoW's lacking customisation options. There's some new stuff in Shadowlands coming out, but I'd like to just go all out on making more stuff - [mostly minor little things](https://twitter.com/keyboardturn/status/1197625790671622146).
